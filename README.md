# 19-Unsupervised-Learning

This repository demonstrates the use of SciKit-Learn to implement an unsupervised learning model and analyze cryptocurrency data. The price changes of cryptocurrencies were examined over various time intervals using K-means clustering. First, the data was normalized using StandardScaler, and an elbow chart was generated to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) for the dataset. The data was then clustered using K-means, enabling the identification of groups of cryptocurrencies with similar price change behavior patterns, which can inform investment strategies and identify outliers.

Next, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed with three principal components, accounting for 88.9% of the original variance. The elbow chart and K-means clustering were repeated on the PCA-transformed data. While the optimal value of k remained at 4, the inflection point in the elbow chart became more distinct. Additionally, the clusters derived from the PCA values were tighter and more cleanly separated, reflecting the reduced dimensionality of the original data.
